                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Technology is now a part of everyone's everyday life, but not everyone knows how the technology is made,
                    configured, or updated in order to maintain its use. For me, I've always wondered why things are the way they
                    are and with the help of technology, I'm able to figure out just that. But that's not enough for me. I'm not 
                    just searching for why things are the way they are, but also how everything connects with each other in order 
                    to create the bigger pictures that I see every day. Since I was very young, I've been taking things apart and
                    analyzing them just to know how it works, and at times I would put together my own creations based on what I 
                    found. With computer science, I'm able to do this on a far greater scale, and with the collaboration of similar
                    minded people, I believe that something extraordinary can be made.

                My name is Zachary McGhee and in this blog, I will be recording my journey to a professional career in cybersecurity.
                Currently I'm a student at the University of Memphis studying computer science with a concentration
                    in cybersecurity, but before this I was attending the University of Oregon studying mathematics and computer
                    science.
                I enjoy video games, nature, traveling, everything cybersecurity, and spending time with my friends.*/-->
